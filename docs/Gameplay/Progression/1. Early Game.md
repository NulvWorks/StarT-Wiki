# Early Game

### Sticks and Stones

The starting island has a **Tree** and **Grass**.
The tree will be your source of **Wood Logs**, whereas grass will be your source of **Pebbles**.
Pebbles can be crafted in full blocks of **Cobblestone**, **Andesite**, **Diorite** and **Granite**.

Using above sources, craft yourself:
- Any **Hammer**
- Any **Crook**
- Any **Crucible**
- A **Wooden bucket**
- A **Composter**
- A **Wooden Barrel**
- A few **Furnaces**
- A few **Sieves**

Once you have more than four saplings, insert four saplings in the crucible to make 1 bucket of **Water**.
You can speed this process up using a **Campfire**.

Mine leaves with the crook to obtain **Silkworm**. Use the silkworm(s) on leaves and wait for the leaves to be *fully* infested. Once fully infested, mine them using the crook to obtain **String**.

Use the string to make a few **String Meshes**. Use the string meshes on the sieves.

Mine cobblestone with the hammer to obtain **Gravel**. You can also mine gravel with the hammer to get **Sand** and sand to get **Dust**, but we will need gravel for now.

Use the gravel on the sieves to obtain **Crushed Copper Ore**, **Crushed Iron Ore**, **Crushed Tin Ore**, **Crushed Magnetite Ore** and **Crushed Sphalerite Ore**.
